# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data from 2015 to 2017 to uncover the key factors contributing to booking cancellations. Using Microsoft Excel, I created a comprehensive dashboard with visual insights powered by pivot tables and slicers.

## üß† Objective
Identify the primary reasons for booking cancellations and understand how factors like room assignment, guest type, and booking month influence cancellations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Added new columns (`room_status`, `guest_type`) using Excel formulas (`IF`, `AND`).
- **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Built 5 pivot tables and linked them to slicers for dynamic year-wise analysis.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Designed a visually appealing dashboard to display insights with pie and bar charts.

## üìà Key Insights
1. **Guest Type vs Cancellations:**
   - Couples had the highest number of bookings (81,560) but also significant cancellations (32,424).
2. **Room Assignment Impact:**
   - When guests received their desired room, cancellations were lower (43,422 out of 104,473).
3. **Monthly Cancellations:**
   - Cancellations peaked during summer months (May‚ÄìAugust).
4. **Hotel Type Comparison:**
   - City Hotels had more bookings (79,330) and higher cancellations (33,102) compared to Resort Hotels.

## üöÄ Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
- **Formulas Used:** `IF`, `AND`, conditional formatting.
